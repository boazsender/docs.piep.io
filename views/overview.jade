    h2 Current Version
    p 
      By default, all requests receive the v0 version of the API. We encourage you to explicitly request this version via the Accept header.
    code Accept: application/vnd.piep.v0+json
  section#schema
    h2 Schema
    p
      All API access is over HTTPS, and accessed from the api.github.com domain (or through yourdomain.com/api/v3/ for enterprise). All data is sent and received as JSON.
    h3 Collection Requests
    p
      When you fetch a list of resources, the response includes a subset of the attributes for that resource. This is the “summary” representation of the resource. (Some attributes are computationally expensive for the API to provide. For performance reasons, the summary representation excludes those attributes. To obtain those attributes, fetch the “detailed” representation.)
    p
      Example: When you get a list of repositories, you get the summary representation of each repository. Here, we fetch the list of repositories owned by the octokit organization:
    code GET /resources/
    h3 Element requests
    p
      When you fetch an individual resource, the response typically includes all attributes for that resource. This is the “detailed” representation of the resource. (Note that authorization sometimes influences the amount of detail included in the representation.)
    p
      Example: When you get an individual repository, you get the detailed representation of the repository. Here, we fetch the octokit/octokit.rb repository:
    code GET /resources/1

    h2 HTTP Verbs
    p
      Where possible, API v0 strives to use appropriate HTTP verbs for each action.

        tr
          th Verb
          th Description
      tbody
        tr
          td
            code HEAD
          td Can be issued against any resource to get just the HTTP header info.
        tr
          td
            code GET
          td Used for retrieving resources.</td>
        tr
          td
            code POST
          td Used for creating resources, or performing custom actions (such as merging a pull request).
        tr
          td
            code PUT
          td.
            Used for replacing resources or collections. For <code>PUT</code> requests with no <code>body</code> attribute, be sure to set the <code>Content-Length</code> header to zero.
        tr
          td 
            code DELETE
          td Used for deleting resources.
